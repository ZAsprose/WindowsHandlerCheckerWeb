## english
A MVC website to check Handles of existing windows and try to list Handles of its sub elements

Display Handle and Title of all current existing window in Windows. Fetch one of them (using copy&paste) to backend, and try to get the Handle of its elements if it's a regular app window, or Chrome.

It's a play-around project to go through the process of fetching information of windows app. I set it up using my old Win 8.1 laptop I brought in my college, so somehow the framework and structure is out-of-date.

The windowsUtils class is the key file of all the windows related operations. Archive it for need.
